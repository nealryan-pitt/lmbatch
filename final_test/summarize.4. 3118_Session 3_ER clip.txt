Let's craft ~120 words.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>The therapist explains two main coping styles that can be done from bed: **distress tolerance** (toughing out bad feelings) and **emotion‑regulation** (actively changing how you feel). The client shares simple tactics—taking a nap, watching shows, playing video games—to calm anger or frustration. They also discuss chronic sleep problems, noting that all‑nighters give temporary energy but leave them exhausted; the therapist stresses that consistent sleep is key to mood regulation and suggests consulting a sleep specialist and continuing therapy. Finally, the therapist introduces **savoring**—intentionally focusing on positive moments—to counteract the tendency to dwell on negatives, especially in depression or anxiety. The session ends with an assessment of current distress level.
