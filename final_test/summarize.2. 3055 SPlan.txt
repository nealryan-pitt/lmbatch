Sienna’s safety plan focuses on daily emotional monitoring (“daily dose”), coping skills, and support networks to prevent self‑harm.  
- **Daily Dose:** She will rate her mood each day and practice a chosen coping skill (e.g., deep breathing, going outside) even when feeling fine, so the skill is readily available in crisis.  
- **Coping Skills:** Watching TV, bathing, drawing/painting, listening to music, and deep breathing are identified as useful tools for managing distress.  
- **Triggers & Avoidance:** Arguments with people and recalling negative past events trigger suicidal thoughts. She plans to express discomfort early, limit contact until calm, and use distraction or positive memories to shift focus.  
- **Reasons for Living:** Family (sister, parents, brother) and future goals (becoming a psychologist, being supportive).  
- **Support Contacts:** Crisis text line, Resolve, her mother, and brother are listed as people she can reach out to if needed.  
- **Environment Safety:** Her dad keeps razors and other sharp objects out of reach; medication is stored safely with her dad.  

The plan integrates monitoring, skill practice, trigger management, meaningful reasons for living, and a clear safety network.
