- **Core tech**: Machine learning lets computers improve from data; deep learning uses multi‑layer neural networks and powers breakthroughs in vision, language, and speech.  
- **Key uses**:  
  - *Healthcare*: diagnosis, drug discovery, personalized care.  
  - *Transport*: self‑driving cars.  
  - *Finance*: fraud detection, algorithmic trading.  
  - *Entertainment*: recommendation engines that suggest movies or music.  
- **Challenges**: algorithm bias, job loss from automation, privacy risks, and the need for transparent decision‑making.  

The promise of AI is huge, but society must manage its ethical and practical impacts so benefits are shared widely while minimizing harm.
