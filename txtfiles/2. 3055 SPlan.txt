That you feel confident that you can keep yourself safe and that the emotion that you experience around being alive is happiness.

So when we talk about a safety plan and staying safe, one of the first things that we talk about in this program is, like I mentioned before, doing something on a regular basis to try and help get in the practice of changing the emotional thermostat and keeping track of your temperature.

So this is something that we call a daily dose, just to be, you know, have an easy term for it.

And the idea of this is to do two things.

The first is to practice forecasting by taking your temperature each day.

So when it comes to kind of managing distress, the first idea in climate control or for your emotions or this kind of emotional control is to see changes in your thermometer, to see them coming before they get there.

So one of the things that we learned as you went through that chain analysis is that the event that, you know, kind of ended things when you went in the bathroom and you got the extension cord, it was building.

You described that it had been well over an hour from the time that you were feeling down and had texted your friends.

So sometimes people, you know, we can all feel at times like sometimes our difficulties kind of like erupt.

But when we look at it the way that you did, you were able to very clearly describe the ways that it built up over time.

So this climate control idea can be useful for some people if we're willing to look at the thermometer on a regular basis.

So the first part of this is to just kind of practice taking that temperature each day.

Do you have questions about that?

No.

Okay.

And then the second part of it is to actually practice coping skills to deal with distress.

You already described several that work for you, like watching TV, taking a bath.

It sounds like often reaching out to people.

You know, this was a really, I wouldn't say it was a really upsetting interaction with your friend.

But do you typically reach out to people as a coping skill?

Okay.

What other types of things do you do?

Listen to music or draw.

Drawing.

Okay.

Drawing and painting are those things that you find kind of help you keep your emotional temperature. steady?

Yeah.

Okay.

So again, the idea here is that, have you ever heard the phrase, fix the roof when the sun is shining?

No.

Okay.

And we're not fixing something.

That's the best analogy I could think of in the moment.

So the idea is that we're practicing something and not necessarily when we need it.

So for example, if a roof is leaky, when you really find out is when it starts to rain.

So oftentimes the best time to get it into good shape is when you don't need it to protect you from the rain.

So you can think of using coping skills the same way.

The idea is to take a temperature each day and then practice some sort of skill because practicing them, even in moments when your temperature isn't really high, can often help people find them more accessible.

So you mentioned during the chain analysis that it didn't come into your head to try one of those skills earlier, right?

Yeah.

Yeah.

So the idea of practicing it is so that they're more kind of accessible.

They're easier to grab, easier to pop into your head in a moment when you really need them.

So this could work by taking your temperature and choosing something that you like to do and just doing it that day and just kind of keeping track of how your temperature is day to day.

The idea here is that the first thing that we do is we tolerate the distress.

And then the second thing that we do is if we notice that it's high, we try to turn the temperature down.

Do you have any questions about that?

No.

Okay.

So that is the first part is what we call this daily dose.

And the second thing that might be different about the safety plan is that we use a skill called reasons for living.

And the purpose of this is to be able to remind ourselves, you know, about the things that we're looking forward to, the things we like to do, and the things that are meaningful in our lives.

So this is a little different than on the type of safety plan you did in the hospital where you kind of fill out, you know, you start usually with the coping skills or your triggers.

Um, this is a separate section, um, that we add.

So one of the things that I am wondering is if you can tell me, um, you know, if you think about kind of what you want out of life, you said that you were happy, um, that you were still alive.

What kinds of things are you looking forward to or what kind of goals do you have for your life?

Like being there for my sister and being a psychologist.

Okay.

Is your sister someone that you care really deeply for?

Yeah.

Yeah.

When you think about that emotion that you described of being happy that you are alive, what other people come to mind is the people that you really care about and that you, you know, when you think about that happiness of being alive, these are the people that come to mind?

My mom and my dad.

Okay. your sister your mom and your dad anyone else uh my brother too is it older or younger brother i don't think i knew you had a brother older older brother okay any specific friends or other people in your life uh yeah my best friend do you have a first name for your best friend So I can put it on your safety plan.

Taylor, Desiree, and Amira.

Okay.

Okay.

So there's the people you really care about.

There's the goals you have of becoming a psychologist, being there for your sister, in addition to kind of a career goal, like ultimately of becoming a psychologist.

Are there any other things that you're looking forward to, like either in high school or after high school?

um no um and then what about things that bring meaning to your life or that you really like to do so these can be like either activities they can be places you like to go um i like going to the pool and my grandparents house going to the pool visiting grandparents um what about the sports or art activities that you mentioned earlier do those bring a lot of meaning um or they do consider them more of coping skills um they bring meaning too okay would you like me to add those yeah okay Okay.

So going to the pool, visiting your grandparents, drawing and painting and playing volleyball?

Yeah.

Okay.

So the next thing I'm going to ask, Sienna, might be more like what was on your safety plan from the hospital.

You know, we talked a lot about a very specific event in this chain.

But when you think either about the event we talked about or times in the past, when you've had urges to self-harm or had any thoughts about dying, what kind of triggers can you think of that tend to come before those thoughts or those urges?

Like getting into arguments with people.

Okay.

Or like just remembering something from the past.

When you say remembering something, what kinds of things are these?

Are these negative events?

Are they something different?

Negative.

Are they usually like things that happen to you?

Are they interactions with people?

Both.

Okay.

You mentioned before that when we were talking about the argument you have with your friend, that that tends to trigger a lot of thoughts about people not being there for you.

Are those types of thoughts a trigger for you as well?

Or is it really the arguments?

Both.

Okay.

So, and does this sound familiar, Sienna?

Is this something they asked you to do on your previous safety plan?

Something like it.

Something like it.

Okay.

So after we identify the triggers, what we ask about is ways that you might avoid the triggers.

And when I say the word avoid, I just want to clarify that avoiding doesn't always mean, you know, just like avoiding a place, you know, or a person.

Sometimes avoiding things is, you know, if you, let me give an example that, let's say a teen and their parent, one of their triggers is arguments with their parents about homework.

One way that they might avoid it is to kind of have an agreement with their parents that We're only going to talk about homework for this amount of time, or we're not going to have certain types of conversations about homework.

So avoiding can also be, you know, kind of setting up ways to limit how much a trigger, how far a trigger can go.

So I just wanted to say that to like, you know, give you a little bit of freedom and thinking about that.

So in terms of getting into arguments with people, the thoughts that people aren't there from you and remembering the things from the past, what are some ways that you might avoid your triggers?

Um, maybe like if someone says something that I don't like, just tell them that I don't like it.

But if they continue, just not text them until I feel better or like I calm down from the situation.

Okay. instead of like, like feeding into it.

Okay.

Yeah, that's really insightful.

So you express how you're being impacted by the conversation or remove yourself before the argument can grow.

Yeah.

Okay.

Any other ways that you might avoid your triggers?

What about avoiding remembering things from the past?

Maybe, like, I guess I can try not to think about it.

Or if I do think about it, try to think about, like, good things instead.

Okay.

Or, like, I guess, like, if something, like, for example, if something happened and like, you know, I had friends that were there to come for me.

I can think about that.

So replacing the thought.

Yeah.

Okay.

You mentioned before trying not to think about it.

Does that typically work for you?

Sometimes.

Okay.

If I'm like distracting myself.

Okay.

So by using distraction. thank you for clarifying um i know that that can be hard for people to just not think about something so i was curious you know kind of what that looked like for you um and then you know you listed for me a handful of coping skills before what coping skills um could you use when you experience those triggers?

Um, listening to music because I really like music.

So that helps a lot.

Yeah.

Anything else?

Um, no.

No.

Okay.

That makes sense.

Um, and is listening to music something that you feel would be kind of accessible to you at most times.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

It sounds, Sienna, like you are being really thoughtful and thinking, you know, you have a lot of coping skills, but things, for example, like drawing or painting, if you're triggered, that might not be available to you in the moment.

Yeah.

So I see that you very insightfully have identified something that you can pretty much access almost whenever you might need it.

So that's a skill you could use to cope with if you're triggered.

When we talked before about doing that daily dose of, you know, taking a daily mood rating and trying, um, you know, and just using one of your coping skills, um, to kind of keep your temperature steady.

What of your coping skills do you described or something that you would be willing to commit to trying if you were going to practice this daily dose, like in the next 24 hours, for example?

Um, maybe like taking deep breaths.

Deep breathing?

Okay.

Or like going outside for a minute, just like relaxing.

Okay.

How easy or hard do you feel like it would be to do, to practice one daily dose before the next time we talk?

to taking one mood rating and trying one skill.

I think I could do it.

It sounds like if you were to commit to it, that this is something that you could do, that you have the skills and you have a lot of insight into what your temperature is.

So if you were to commit to taking your temperature, you feel like you could.

Okay.

Yeah.

So very similar to the safety plan you did in the hospital, the last part is to identify people you could reach out to.

If you were triggered, if your temperature got too high, or if you were feeling like you were no longer confident you could keep yourself safe, who are the people that you would reach out to?

You know, either adults or professionals, Um, or, um, you know, any, I know that Alicia said she sent you the crisis line, um, things like that.

And what I'd like, um, for you to do Sienna is tell me, you know, who these people are that you feel like you would actually feel comfortable reaching out to if you needed support and staying safe.

Um, I think like the crisis line would help.

Resolve?

Yeah.

Or different.

Okay.

Did Alicia tell you about the crisis text number?

Yeah.

Okay.

Is that something that you would use?

Yeah.

Would you like me to add that to the plan?

Yeah.

Okay.

So you've got resolve and the crisis text line.

So something to text and then someone to call.

What about any adults that you know that you would be willing to reach out to?

Would you feel comfortable reaching out to your mom?

Yeah.

Okay.

Do you have your mom's phone number that you could give me that I could put in here?

Actually, you know what?

I have it in your emergency contact.

Don't worry about it.

Anyone else besides your mom that you would like to add?

My brother, too.

Your brother?

Okay.

What's your brother's name?

His first name.

You don't have to tell me his last name.

Lamont.

Lamont.

Okay.

Do you have his phone number in your phone?

Uh, yes.

I have.

Would you mind telling it to me so I can put it here on the plan and I can fill in all the others for resolve and everything.

His is the only number I think we don't have.

His number is 412-904 -8467.

8467.

Okay.

Thank you.

So you have people to reach out to, skills to use to cope with your triggers, ways to avoid your triggers, and you identified three different triggers for me.

So we've talked at this point, Sienna, a lot about kind of coping and reaching out to people.

The very last part of the safety plan I want to check in on is about how you keep your environment safe.

So I believe you all talked a little bit about this with Alicia.

But in terms of access to things like sharps or medications or anything like that, can you tell me, do you and your family have any type of plan for making your environment safe?

Or is that something you've talked about?

I think we've talked about it, yeah.

Okay.

What plan did you come up with?

keeping razors and stuff away or like my medication I don't know where it is my dad the one that keeps it so he gives me my medication okay and what about razors or other sharp things what plan did you make to you mentioned something about putting those away.

What does that look like?

I, well, I think my dad just went around the house and like finding like the razors and stuff like that and putting them somewhere where I can't find them.

Okay.

So your dad has kind of hidden in them at this point and do you know where they are no okay is there anything else that you can think of that would help to keep your environment safe um maybe like if i'm in a room by myself just like knocking and checking up on me every few minutes.

Okay.

Is that something that you feel like would be helpful and that you'd be willing to do?

Yeah.

Okay.

And is this at both houses or primarily at your dad's house?

Primarily at my dad's.

Okay.

Okay.

All right.

Sienna, thank you for sharing all of that.

You're welcome.

So now that we've talked through this, is there anything on the safety plan that you aren't sure that you'd be willing to do?

I don't think so.

No.

Okay.

If your emotional temperature were to go up or, you know, you mentioned before, like you might be feeling less confident at higher numbers that you can use your coping skills effectively.

If that were the case, tell me a little bit about your confidence that you would be able to use the things on this plan?

I'm pretty confident.

Okay.

So you have outlined a lot of different things that if you were to commit to them, you would be willing to do.

If you were feeling like your coping skills might not work, or if you weren't feeling as safe, including being willing to, you know, have your dad check in on you when you're by yourself.

You also mentioned that you would be willing to try one daily dose in the next 24 hours.

Would you be willing when I talk to you next to tell me how it goes and give me some feedback on it?

Sure.

Okay.

And the feedback can be things like either how it went, how motivated you felt to do it, how useful it felt.

So I definitely invite and ask you to give me a really honest feedback on it. and let's see I have a personal email address for you would you like me to email these things directly to you your safety plan your emotional thermometer or would you like me to send it you know to one of your parents email addresses um my email address is fine your email address is fine okay great so one of the things um that we always ask teens to do Sienna is to think about they would feel comfortable sharing this information with a parent.

Are you at your dad's right now?

Yeah.

Okay.

Did you share your safety plan with him from the hospital?

Yeah.

Okay.

How comfortable would you feel sharing this safety plan with him?

That's fine.

That's fine.

Okay.

Yeah.

And is there a specific, is there anything you feel like that easier for you to share it with him?

No.

Okay.

So I'll send it to you.

And would you be willing to share it with him before I talk to you next?

Yeah.

Okay.

And I'm not sure what his schedule is like, but is he ever around during the day?

Yeah.

Okay.

So what I'd like to just wrap up by talking about is
