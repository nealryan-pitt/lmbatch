Today, I thought we could talk about a coping skill that you could actually do from your bed.

So, you know, like you have options here and it's an emotion regulation skill.

So distress tolerance is something that you do to just tough it out through those bad times because you know that emotion isn't going to last.

And if you can just, you know, make it until things get better.

You'll be OK.

And it's usually a good place to start, because if you give yourself a little bit of space and time to think about the situation, you can kind of make a better decision.

Right.

Then than acting impulsively.

But another sort of type of coping skill is emotion regulation.

And so that's when we're really actively trying to change the way we feel.

So we're not just sort of like waiting until it gets better, but we're going to do something to make our make ourselves feel better.

Is there anything you feel like you do now that might be an emotion regulation skill that might be something you do?

To make yourself feel better?

I mean, what a distraction count is that?

Sometimes.

How do you distract yourself?

I mean, sometimes if I'm like really upset or exhausted, I'll just take a nap.

And then I'll wake up and I'll feel fine.

OK.

Or I'll watch my show that I like.

Yeah.

Or I'll like play a video game.

Or my new thing is, is I got Mortal Kombat a while ago.

But, hi Sally.

But it never worked.

I don't know what it was, but the disc never worked.

But I got it to work the other day.

So my new thing is, whenever I get mad, I turn on Mortal Kombat and I beat the shit out of someone.

All right.

And then I usually rage because I get killed because I don't know the controls.

So I'm just spam pressing the buttons.

That's how I play video games.

All you see is, whoosh.

Damn it.

Don't you dare.

Now, does that make you feel better?

Or does that make you feel worse?

Because you get killed.

Well, I get mad like in the moment.

But when it's over, it's like, it's just the game.

It's all good.

OK.

OK.

And it lets me get my anger out too because Mortal Kombat is like so violent.

Uh-huh.

It's like you're actually like hurting like someone or yourself, but you're not actually hurting them because they're not real.

OK.

OK.

But it lets you have the same experience, but it's like a visionary experience, but it's not actually happening.

Sure.

So that sounds like that's like a way that you can release some of your frustration or anger.

Yeah.

And I thought your point about like the nap, right, that like maybe part of why you're feeling so bad is because you're tired or you don't have enough sleep.

And so I definitely agree that like getting enough sleep and making sure that you're sleeping enough all the time is a great emotion regulation strategy because we can definitely be more emotional when when we're not getting enough sleep.

Yeah.

But the weird thing with me is you're like kind of like a doctor, right?

Yeah.

I'm a psychologist.

So I'm a doctor of psychology.

OK.

I have a question.

If I like stay up all night, like.

So if I wake up one day and then I stay up all day and then I stay up all night and then I stay up the next day.

But the next day when I like.

Yeah.

I'm trying to keep up with the math here.

Yeah.

OK.

So just say I pull an all nighter.

And like.

So you're up for like 24 hours.

Yeah.

So like the morning that I pull the all nighter, I have like this boost of energy after pulling the all nighter.

And it's like, well, I can do anything.

I can get everything done.

And then it lasts like all day.

And then I pass out like around seven.

OK.

So you're up for like 36 hours.

Yeah.

Like a day and a half.

Yeah.

So I pass out like around seven.

But that's like the only day that I get motivation and feel like I can do anything.

Is if I pull an all nighter.

And OK.

And you said you had a question.

So I want to.

I just.

Is that normal?

Um.

Because I asked the guy at my partial program.

OK.

And he says that he knows it's not normal, but he doesn't know what it is.

And what did you think of that answer?

I was like.

I mean, I like that guy.

He's real nice.

I was like.

I was like.

I was like.

I mean, he knows it's not normal.

So he kind of answered my question.

But now I kind of know what it is that's causing that.

Oh.

Hmm.

I would be curious.

Like, why did you pull an all nighter?

Did you already feel like you didn't need a lot of sleep?

I just wasn't tired.

And I knew if I went to bed whenever I did, I wouldn't get up for school in the morning.

So I hear that you're saying I wasn't tired.

But I also hear you saying that if you went to bed, you wouldn't wake up.

Yeah.

So what happens is like I'm not tired.

And then I get tired at like six.

Oh, I see.

So like you.

If you went to bed at 6 a.m., you wouldn't get up for school because it's like you had to be.

OK.

Well, I mean, I do.

I have heard from some people that they have periods of.

You know, really disrupted sleep, basically.

Right.

That their sleep cycle is really disruptive.

And that you can kind of have maybe a little bit of like a loopy feeling or maybe wired feeling if you've gone so long without sleep.

And I don't really know like the neurochemistry behind it.

I'm not.

I don't really like the word normal.

I don't know.

Like, I'm not sure if it's normal or not.

And I can't.

I can't really say for certain, but I guess I'm wondering, like, how does this impact you?

Like, I would imagine that if you're staying up for 36 hours and then crashing, that.

It's hard to have a pretty like balanced mood if you're going through these like extremes with your sleep.

Well, that's the weird thing.

I can only pull all nighters like once every two weeks.

Mm hmm.

Well, technically 36 hours, but I can only pull them once like every two weeks.

And I just stay up on like I wake up.

I stay up.

I stay up all night.

And then I stay up all day.

And I pass out around like seven.

Mm hmm.

And then I sleep until I get woken up the next morning.

Like the other day.

Mm hmm.

I passed out at like I was playing my game the Sims and I was on FaceTime with my friends.

And I got told from my friends that I fell asleep on FaceTime snoring.

No.

But I'm sitting here with my neck sitting up so I can like actually like play my game and everything.

Uh huh.

My eyes are doing this.

Hmm.

And I'm like and I'm like keeping my eyes open.

And then like next thing I know, my mom's trying to take my computer off my lap.

So I wake up and I'm like, what?

What?

No, I'm taking it.

I'm not done playing yet.

Yeah.

Well, let's see.

Your mom mentioned that you guys are working with a therapist.

How often do you see this therapist?

Uh, we were seeing her like once or twice a week.

But, um, my insurance can't pay for her and the partial program.

Right.

So will you go back to her?

That's really common, unfortunately.

But will you go back to her once the partial is done?

I mean, yeah.

I'm hoping so.

Okay.

What do you think about talking to your therapist who I think probably, you know, you know, has had the chance to get to know you so much better about some of this sleep question?

Because I think it's really like an important question.

And, um, I want you to be able to talk to somebody who, like, has, you know, has just known you for longer and knows more about everything going on.

I mean, I could ask her about it.

But I don't know if she'd have an answer.

Yeah, well, you know, I'll admit with psychology, not everything has a super easy answer.

But she might have some thoughts about it.

And she might also have some ideas about how to help you regulate your sleep a bit better.

Yeah, but that's the weird thing.

Like, so, like, whenever I finally passed out, my mom woke me up the next morning.

And it took her, like, a couple minutes to wake me up.

Uh-huh.

But I woke up and I was like, I was like, okay.

And I was still tired because I'm always tired.

Yeah, I would imagine you were still tired after being awake for 36 hours.

Yeah, but, like, no matter how much I sleep, I'm always tired.

Except at night when you're supposed to be sleeping, it sounds like.

But the only time I'm not tired is if I'm going all night in.

Yeah.

Yeah, you know, sleep is a really delicate thing.

And it can take time to change.

Like, if you're in a habit, right, of doing things a certain way, like staying up or not getting a lot of sleep, it can take time to change that.

You know, you might think about, like, you know, that's something that might take weeks, not days.

Yeah.

So, like, I think it's really insightful of you that you're even thinking about sleep and thinking about, like, how does sleep impact your mood, right?

The fact that, like, if you're really tired, it can be easier to get upset.

And that, like, having in mind that having a more consistent sleep schedule might be a good way of keeping your mood more regulated.

And I think, like, fixing your sleep is probably, like, a long-term goal.

Because I think that will take some time.

Like, you can make progress, you know, every day, but, like, it will kind of take time.

Yeah, but every time I make progress, it's just, like, I just, like, go back to the beginning.

Because, like, I'm, like, I don't know what it is, but I'm, like, a super deep sleeper.

But somehow I never get enough sleep.

Yeah.

But, like, my mom showed, like, I've had my phone alarm going off.

I have this huge alarm that vibrates my bed and screams.

And my mom has literally, like, put water on my face and everything.

And I sleep through all of it.

Okay.

Well, you know...

My mom brings my medication downstairs.

Uh-huh.

And I'm like this.

And she's like, take this.

And I'm like...

And then she gives me the medication, hands me a drink, and in my sleep I do this.

And go right back to sleep.

If you are thinking that sleep is, like, an important piece of keeping your mood regulated, which seems like a really insightful and smart thing to be thinking, why don't I ask some of the people I work with if they have any good ideas of maybe other, like, like, real experts in sleep that you might be able to talk to about this.

Because I agree that it seems really important.

And just thinking back from what your mom was saying last time, it also sounds like it does create some conflict between you and her.

It does, because she...

Every morning she screams at me for a long hour.

And so it might...

Yeah, it might be that kind of addressing some of the sleep would help you in a couple of different ways then.

Yeah.

Okay.

So I will look into that.

And I will send you, like, a text or, you know, give you a call.

Give me, like...

Like, till the end of next week.

Okay.

Because I'll have to reach out to them and I'll have to, like, wait to hear back.

And so give me a little bit of time.

But I will look into that for you.

Okay.

Thank you.

Yeah, of course.

Like I said, I don't mean to be repeating myself.

But I do think it's, like, very smart and, like, very insightful of you to be thinking about this.

Right?

Because so many things can impact how we feel.

And, again, I just think it's very intelligent and insightful of you to be thinking and realizing that your sleep might impact how you feel.

One of the things I wanted to teach you today was a skill called savoring.

Now, have you heard the word savoring before?

Yeah, when you savor your food.

Yeah, right?

And so when you savor your food, what are you doing?

Making it last longer.

Uh-huh.

And, like, really enjoying it.

So maybe you're even savoring your slushie.

I'm not sure.

I am.

Yeah.

I still have it.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So, I know.

I, you know what, I want to, like, if I'm eating a piece of cheesecake, I want to savor every bite of that.

Is there other food that you like to savor?

Because it's just so delicious.

Um.

I mean, a lot of the food I eat, I just wolf it down.

But I guess if I have to savor something.

It would probably be pasta.

Mm.

That's a good, good choice there.

I'm a pasta nerd.

So, I think, we're going for an analogy here.

Okay.

A little corny, but bear with me here.

So, moment to moment in our life.

Just like you said, like, when you're eating food, like, you, you might just, like, wolf it down, you know?

I think we kind of go through life a lot of times like that.

Where we don't pay a whole lot of attention to the positive things that happen or the small positive moments.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And, like, in particular, like, if we have depression or anxiety or, you know, mood problems, our brain is, in fact, you know, like, really hyper-attuned to all the negative stuff.

And we, like, are, like, programmed to sort of ignore or discount the positive stuff.

And so, savoring is basically practicing, enjoying, and, like, making the positive moments last.

So, I'm wondering, do you notice in yourself a tendency to maybe focus on negative or more easily recall negative things?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Sometimes people tell me that, like, well, someone can say five nice things to me and one negative thing, and I will, you know, really fixate on the negative thing and forget the positive things.

Does that ever happen to you?

Yeah.

Yeah.

So, you like YouTube, right?

You talked about liking YouTube.

You know how, like, YouTube has the recommended for you.

Yeah.

Right?

So, I know, like, do you watch Linkybox?

Do you know who that is?

No.

Okay.

Okay.

So, okay.

Okay.

Okay.

These are two YouTube streamers.

My kids are obsessed with them.

And they get on the Linkybox channel.

And they could just, like, recommend it for you, recommend it for you, for hours.

Linkybox.

Watching Linkybox play Minecraft.

You know?

Because once you get on that video, YouTube is like, and this, and this, and this, and this.

And it's all on, like, the same theme.

So, in a way, our mind is like that.

That we can get a little stuck playing the negative reel in our head.

The negative highlight reel in our head.

Does that ever happen to you?

Yeah.

Yeah.

And what happens to your mood when that happens to you?

I don't know.

I just try and replace it with something else.

Okay.

Do you try and replace it because when you think about all that negative stuff, it makes you feel bad?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

It does.

It's, like, could be, like, a negative cycle, right?

Do you feel better when you think about the positive stuff?

Hmm.

It just depends.

Sure.

Yeah.

So, the idea behind sabering is that we're going to pick a positive memory that you have.

And we're going to kind of bring it to life in your mind.

Really, like, delve really deep into your mind.

And we're going to see how you feel after doing that.

Okay?

Okay.

So, right now, if you had to say, you know, on a scale of zero to five, how distressed you are, how much emotional pain you're in.

You know, five is, like, the worst pain ever.

And zero is you're, like, cool as a cucumber, feeling good.

How much pain do you think you're in right now?

Three.

Three.

Three.

Three.

Three.

Three.

Okay.

All right.

All right.

So, I'm going to sort of make a mental note of that, and we'll come back to that.

So, now I'd like you to think about, like, can you think of a time when you felt, like, happy or at peace or calm?

Like, a memory.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And when are you thinking of?

Tell me a little bit about the memory.

Just, like, a bunch of times with me and my cat when we used to play in the morning.

Okay.

Can you think of one time in particular?

He let me ride around on his lawnmower when we mowed the grass together.

Okay.

So, if you feel comfortable, I would love it if you could close your eyes.

But if not, that's okay.

You don't have to.

And I want you to think about this memory, and I want you to tell me everything you can see.

Paint the picture so that I can see it in my mind.

What do you see in this memory?

It's my old house.

Okay.

And we're on a lawnmower, a tractor.

Mm-hmm.

And we're coming up the big hill, and he has his earmuffs on.

Mm-hmm.

And he has his hands on the steering wheel, and I have my hands on the steering wheel.

And we're just, like, steering it together.

Yeah.

And what colors are you noticing?

The tractor was yellow and green.

It was, like, one of those deer-something tractors.

Mm-hmm.

And I'm pretty sure my pap had one of his hats on.

Mm-hmm.

And do you remember, like, what you were wearing or the color of the sky?

I think he was wearing a blue polo shirt.

Mm-hmm.

And what do you see, like, what does the sky look like?

It was, like, a light blue.

Mm-hmm.

And it sounds like you can probably see grass in your memory.

Yeah.

What color was the grass, would you say?

It was, like, green and yellow.

Green and yellow.

Okay.

Anything else?

Any other plants or animals or?

Yeah, we had our flowers that were in the front yard.

Mm-hmm.

Okay.

I want you to think, like, what do you feel in that memory, right?

Like, are there physical sensations that you can remember?

You know, maybe it's the temperature of the air.

Um, I don't know.

It was pretty warm out.

Okay.

So maybe you could feel even the sun on your skin.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And I'm wondering if you, I've never ridden a tractor, but, or a riding mower, but I would imagine that there's some sort of, like, rumble as you're sitting there riding on it.

Yeah, it goes.

Uh-huh.

And can you, like, feel that in your body?

Yeah.

Yeah, that kind of, like, vibration.

Anything else you think you kind of were physically feeling in that memory?

I don't know.

Grateful.

Grateful, yeah.

So, yeah, let's talk about those emotions.

So it sounds like you felt grateful.

Any other emotions that you felt then?

Happy.

Happy.

Safe, maybe.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

And what did it smell like?

What smells come up for you in this memory?

It was, like, summer and spring is.

Mm-hmm.

So it was, like, the smell of flowers and pollen and, like, trees.

Mm-hmm.

I'm wondering if you had the smell of fresh, fresh cut grass, too.

Yeah, and fresh air.

And fresh air.

Yeah.

Yeah.

And any tastes?

Any taste that goes with this memory?

Um, I'm pretty sure I got a bug in my mouth.

Okay.

Okay.

So really tasty.

Yeah.

I think I was, like, talking with my pap nuts.

Uh-huh.

And a gnat flew in my mouth.

Oh, okay.

At my old house, so many gnats flew into my eye.

Okay, so then here's our last, um, our last sentence, our hearing, right?

What sounds are you hearing in this memory?

Uh, the birds chirping, the lawnmower going.

Um, rocks clattering.

Mm.

Maybe the sound of your pap's voice or your voice?

Yeah, my voice, because I was talking to him, but he had his earmuffs on.

Okay.

So, so we've gone through your, all the sort of senses of this memory, and we've talked about how grateful and warm and safe you felt, and all the beautiful colors that you, that were part of this memory.

And, and I wonder, how does it feel to talk about it?

How does it feel to remember it in that way?

Well, it feels good, but it's also a bit sad.

Sure.

So there's a piece of it that makes, makes you maybe miss your pap, and another piece that feels good?

Yeah.

Can you tell me about the piece that feels good?

Um, I'm just spending that time with my parents.

Mm-hmm. remembering when, when you felt happy and carefree.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So, I want you to go ahead and open your eyes for me.

Um, I wonder if you're feeling pretty relaxed now.

Yeah. maybe, maybe this might be something you do before bed to help you go to sleep.

Could you imagine that?

That would be good.

Yeah.

So, compared to how you felt before, before we did this, any, have you, are you noticing any changes in your mood or how you're feeling?

Um, I'm more tired.

Yeah.

I'm noticing that in you, too.

That you seem more relaxed and more peaceful and tired.

Yeah.

So, so maybe, this might be something that you'd want to use when it's time for bed to help you get to sleep a little earlier.

Do you think that would work for you?

Yeah.

Yeah.

What about using this idea of savoring a positive memory in times when you are, um, not necessarily trying to go to sleep, but just trying to, to turn your mind towards something happy?

Can, can you imagine doing that?

Yeah.

Yeah.

What do you think the benefit of using an activity like this might be for you?

Um, it'll relax me.

And, and why is that good?

Or why is that a benefit?

Um, because then I'm not stressed out and worried all the time.

I can just relax.

Mm.

So it'd be nice to feel relaxed.

Yeah.

It'd be nice not to be so stressed out.

Yeah.

I hear that.

So.

I, I, I'm, I'm sort of wondering.

I'm, for a second I was like, oh, don't go to sleep on me.

Um, I'm wondering.

Right.

We started off by talking about this, this jar of positive things that you might use.

And, um, and I know we sort of said, well, you sort of said like, well, you, you know, like, you, there's a part of you that is just sort of feeling unmotivated to do it, even though there's another part of you that's really, um, thinks it would be helpful and wants to do it.

Yeah.

And I'm thinking about how this savoring activity might be, might have been something, you know, if I just told you like, okay, well, practice this at home by yourself might have been hard to get the motivation to do it.

But now that you've done it, it seems like you feel like it would be pretty helpful.

Um, so I'm glad that we got to practice that in session.

I appreciate you being willing to do that.

I just dripped my slishy on my pillow.

I won't tell anyone.

That's what I get for trying to drink my drink sideways.

So this is our last session together as part of the ASAP research study.

And I think it might make sense to just take a little bit of time to like review what we've talked about, but also time for you to think about like, if there was anything that we did talk about that you want to sort of remember and carry forward.

So, um, like the first session, right, we did your reasons for living list and your safety plan.

And then we've talked about distress tolerance and emotion regulation, right?

And, and in that we've talked about, um, possibly making a jar with like happy things in there to help you sort of make it through.

And this idea of savoring and also like working on your sleep.

So out of all of that, right, is there anything that you want to remember or you want to carry with you?

Um, all of it.

Yeah.

Was it helpful?

What do you, how, how was it helpful?

I mean, it's going to help me like whenever I need to cope with stuff in the future.

Mm-hmm.

And it's important to you to do that because I know you said you want to be a mom and you want to have all sorts of animals.

Yeah.

And to meet your person.

Yeah.

So if you had to pick, you don't have to, but if you had to pick the thing that you think would be the most helpful for you, what would you say?

Um, I don't know.

Maybe the first one.

This, the reasons for living and the safety plan?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

You, I, I think you liked making that reasons for living list.

I did.

Yeah.

You know, and it's, you saying that is actually making me kind of think that like reading your reasons for living might be an emotion regulation coping skill.

Because I bet when you read that, and, and I think you did, as we talked about it, you even said like, oh, it's making me kind of happy and feel hopeful to, to be talking about it.

So maybe that's, that's a really important skill for you then to know about.

Yeah.

Well, from my end, it has been such a delight and a pleasure to get to know you, Jade.

I really am, um, just deeply and genuinely, um, grateful that you were willing to participate in this study, but also were willing to show up at these sessions and, and be, be so truly yourself.

And I feel like that was a real gift that you gave to me.

And, and so I appreciate that.

I, I truly do.

Um, and.

I am so hopeful for you.

Thank you.

Yeah, I am.

I really am.

And, and I, I'm, I'm just like, I'm really like right now, like in my heart, right?

Like thinking about how you said, like, I know with time it does get better.

Right.

And I, I'm, I'm holding that loud and clear for you.

Yeah.

So what's going to happen now is in like, I am going to follow up with you about the, the, um, the sleep stuff.

Right.

But also I'll follow up with you in about a week just to do like a quick touch base about how you're doing using your skills.

Right.

So we'll touch base.

We'll see what's going on.

See if you need any other help.

And then we'll, we'll do that again.

So I'm going to talk to you two more times for just kind of like quick phone calls.

Okay.

And then, um, you'll have your like follow-up assessments and stuff like that too.

Okay.

If you have any questions or any concerns, um, about like the research study or things like that, you're, you're welcome to text me.

Hey, you have my number.

Um, and you know, like I will get back to you.

If it's an emergency, um, my number is not a great one to use because, because I, I do sleep at night.

I do not stay up all night.

And so I might not be able to get back to you, um, super quickly.

If it's, you know, during, not during, if it's not during the day.

So I recommend, you know, talking with your mom or calling resolve or calling that crisis line that we talked about, right?

That crisis text line, 741-741.

All right.

Do you have any questions for me or anything, you know, you want to say now?

No, I'm all good.

Yeah.

All right.

You may be thinking about getting some sleep when we hang up.

Yeah.

I think that seems like a really good idea.

I'm glad that we were able to do something that helped you feel kind of relaxed.

What do you think?

Do you think you might choose to, to think more about that memory before when we hang up?

Yeah.

Yeah.

All right.

Well then I'll be curious to hear how that goes when I talk to you in about a week.

Okay.

All right.

Take care, Jade.

Okay.

Take care.

Be well.

Bye.

Thank you.
