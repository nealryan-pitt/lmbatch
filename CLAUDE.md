## Project Overview

This is a Python project called "lmbatch" - currently a minimal starter project with a simple main function that prints "Hello from lmbatch!".

## Development Setup

- Python 3.13+ required
- Uses uv for dependency management (based on pyproject.toml structure)
- Virtual environment recommended (see .gitignore for .venv)

## Running the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point with main() function
- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration and dependencies
- `.gitignore`: Standard Python gitignore patterns

## Notes

- This appears to be a new/starter project with minimal implementation
- No external dependencies currently defined
- No tests, linting, or build processes configured yet
